## Skills

Building an **Interactive Rating** website using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** was a really rewarding experience for me. From the start, I wanted to create something simple yet well-designed, with an intuitive and responsive interface.  

I began by structuring the **HTML**, ensuring a clear and organized layout. Then, I moved on to **CSS**, where I worked a lot with flexbox and animations to make the experience smoother. The most challenging part was **JavaScript**, as I had to handle events and dynamically store the userâ€™s rating.  

Throughout the process, I significantly improved my skills, especially in **JavaScript**, gaining a better understanding of DOM manipulation and event handling. Additionally, I learned to focus more on **user experience**, making sure the design was intuitive and responsive. In the end, I was really satisfied with the result and felt a great improvement in my web development skills.
